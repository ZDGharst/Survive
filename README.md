# Survive

This project is a personal project for the class COMP-SCI 490: Introduction to Unity at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Playable through the web browser at: 

## Project Description

I do not feel I am a very creative person, so I've used assets from many different sources (all assets used have their licenses examined before use in this project) and attempted to create a unique experience through programming fun gameplay mechanics.

In this game, the goal is for the player's turret to survive for as long as possible against hordes of zombies. The turret will aim in the direction of the user's mouse, and the player may use WASD to pan the camera or the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Every 30 minutes, tombstones spawn (the amount that spawn is exponential with time). Every 6 seconds, a zombie spawns from one of those tombstones.

The player may click to spawn a missile in the direction of the turret head, and if that missile connects with an enemy zombie/tombstone, it will deal damage. The zombies, if left unchecked, will move toward the turret and kill it.

## Future Scope

Software products are never complete. Some ideas that can further improve this game:

- Allow the player to purchase upgrades for their turret using earned currency.
- Allow the player to build a mobile army in order to go on the offensive against hard to reach tombstones.
- Allow the player to build more defensive structures (walls, additional turrets, etc.).
- Improve the environment and make it more detailed.
- Fade in/out between scenes.
- Add Additional background songs during the game.
- Provide a difficulty selector for the player.
- Change the sounds for explosions, zombies, etc. to come from the environment's source rather than global.
